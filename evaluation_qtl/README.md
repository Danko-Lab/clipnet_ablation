# QTL prediction benchmark

This directory contains notebooks for evaluating the ablated models at predicting QTL effects. The notebooks contained in the base directory will generate the plots used in the paper.

Python scripts in `diqtl_predict/` and `tiqtl_predict/` were used to actually generate the predictions, but these still need quite a bit of cleaning up.

TODO: Rewrite prediction scripts to directly use Zenodo accessions.
